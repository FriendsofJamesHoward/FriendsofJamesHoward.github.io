Maryland has a long-running reputation for being anti-business. But
our state is in the top fifth of states by GDP per capita, beating
the national average by roughly 10 percent every year for the last
10 years. Our only real competitor for business for Virginia, whom
we beat in terms of overall climate. But these advantages are felt
mostly by large businesses, many of them multinational or with
headquarters outside of the state. Much more can be done to make
Maryland's business climate more friendly to aspiring and new
business owners.

We can cut the filing costs for small and family-owned business.
For many small and startup operations, an annual $300 filing fee
is enough to harm profits each year.  We can cut the red tape and
make it easier to get started. Unnecessary and harmful regulations
can be lifted to increase opportunity.

Maryland is business friendly--to big businesses with the money and
influence to get what they want. Thatâ€™s not good enough. Maryland
must be business friendly with a level playing field so small
businesspeople and entrepreneurs can succeed, too.
