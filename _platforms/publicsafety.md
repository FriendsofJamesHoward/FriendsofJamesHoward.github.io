Our public safety should be a highest priority for our government.
We can make sure law enforcement has the resources they need while
making sure individual rights are protected from unwarranted
intrusion.

Our national handgun debate is too much about hot-button buzzwords
and too little about action. On the right, "thoughts and prayers"
have prevented absolutely zero handgun deaths. Ever. And on the
left, calls for "common sense" legislation have fallen upon deaf
ears of executives of both parties on the state and Federal level.
The time has come for real gun control.  Mass shootings have made
that clear.  We must implement meaningful regulations on firearms
and partner with other states to keep them out of Maryland.

We must also reduce the reliance on policing to solve every problem
we encounter.  Police are expected to respond to health care crises,
mental health crises, personal crises, and so many other things
they lack the equipment, training, and experience for.  Our law
enforcement agencies should be partnered with social work agencies,
mental health professionals, and others to ensure responses are
appropriate for the situation at hand.  Finally, those adjuncts to
law enforcement must be properly funded to deal with the problems
they will face.
