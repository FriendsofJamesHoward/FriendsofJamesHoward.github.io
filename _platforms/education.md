Maryland's public education includes some of the finest in the
country, but the benefits are not reaching everyone. Our students,
even when graduating, are not always ready to go to college. And
if they are not ready for college, they are not ready for the
workforce.

Our parents were told, we were told, and we have told our children
that education is the key to success. We want to have the best
schools and best colleges.

To get the best, we have to support our schools and universities.
The Kirwan Commission has made strong recommendations, but there
is more we can do. Our students deserve the best, and we can deliver
it for them with commitment, forethought, and common sense.
