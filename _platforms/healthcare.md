Here in Maryland, we are fortunate to have, not one, but two
world-class healthcare systems grounded in cutting-edge research
and compassionate care for patients. And while the Affordable Care
Act has given many more people access to these systems, the current
administration is trying to tear that up. This isn't our way.

We need broad plan designed to increase access to healthcare for
all and ensure that health protections are secured for everyone.
We must allow all Marylanders to buy into the Medicaid managed care
organization. "Medicaid for Maryland" will ensure access to health
care thatâ€™s always there.

Together, we can protect each other and stop the Federal government
from cutting holes in our social safety net.
