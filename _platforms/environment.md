There's a great deal of talk about the environment. While some
people think thereâ€™s a debate about climate change, scientists are
completely in agreement that climate change is real, man-made, and
a serious threat to people everywhere.

In Maryland, we work to protect the Chesapeake Bay when it is in
our economic interests. It supports our business and play and we
ask much of it. We can do our part to stop polluted runoff. This
will ensure the wildlife population that gives us business and play
will still be there tomorrow.

Finally, we have more miles of coastline than any other state.
Denying climate change is not an option.  Lands throughout have a
high risk of flooding and will for the foreseeable future. We must
work with both Federal and Maryland resources to develop flood
mitigation strategies that can permanently protect our communities.

Our environment is the most important resource we have, but it also
our most delicate. Climate change is affecting everyone, already.
We have already seen the earliest strikes as storms increase in
intensity and frequency. We must prepare for these risks and do
what we can to prevent them if possible and mitigate when not.
