Maryland is known for its traffic, and its reputation is awful.  I
used to drive more than 50 miles each way to go to work in Alexandria.
I understand that frustration when traffic is backing up and there's
no viable alternative.

Mass transit is the key to reducing driving and improving local
employment opportunities. Jobs cluster at transit hubs and a few
minutes on a train is much easier than driving.  We need A concerted
plan to manage growth in Baltimore by tying redevelopment and public
transit together. Jobs and homes should both be transit-accessible.
Similar expansion of the DC Metro will support those serving our
nation. Taking cars off the road will make the commutes easier for
those without Metro access.

At the same time, mass transit will not work for everyone. We must
ensure that our highways, bridges, and other transportation
infrastructure are safe. They must be repaired when needed and
replaced if necessary.  Aging infrastructure is a risk we all bear
and must be ready to address.

Our transportation should serve us, not the other way around.
