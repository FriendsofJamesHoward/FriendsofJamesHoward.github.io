[Last month](/2020/02/06/elizabeth-warren-for-president/), I was
happy to announce that I was standing as a delegate to the [Democratic
National Convention](https://www.demconvention.com/) for [Elizabeth
Warren](https://elizabethwarren.com/).  It was a brief run for me,
but a long one for Senator Warren.  I found myself supporting the
Senator because she has an unmatched ability to surround herself
with people who can solve problems.  That is what I want in my
president.

The Senator has not, as of yet, chosen to make an endorsement.  But
it is clear today that [Joe Biden](https://joebiden.com/) will be
the nominee of the Democratic Party this fall.  On the off-chance
I still end up in Milwaukee this fall, I will support Senator Biden.
And I will support Senator Biden this summer and will be proud to
vote for him this fall.
